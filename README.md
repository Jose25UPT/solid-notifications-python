# Principios SOLID con Python - Sistema de Notificaciones

Este proyecto implementa un ejemplo prÃ¡ctico de los 5 principios SOLID utilizando Python. Simula el envÃ­o de notificaciones por Email y SMS.

## ðŸ”§ TecnologÃ­as
- Python 3
- GitHub Actions (automatizaciÃ³n)

## âœ… Principios aplicados

| Principio | AplicaciÃ³n |
|----------|------------|
| SRP      | `Mensaje` solo representa un mensaje |
| OCP      | Nuevas clases como WhatsApp se pueden aÃ±adir sin modificar `ServicioEnvio` |
| LSP      | `EnvioEmail` y `EnvioSMS` pueden reemplazarse entre sÃ­ |
| ISP      | `Enviador` es una interfaz especÃ­fica para enviar |
| DIP      | `ServicioEnvio` depende de la interfaz `Enviador`, no de clases concretas |

## ðŸš€ CÃ³mo ejecutar
```bash
python solid_example.py
```
# What is a Principle?

A principle is a broad behavioral guideline applicable to many situations. In general, a principle doesn't tell you exactly what to do, but rather gives you clues as to the correct course of action across a wide range of situations. The details are up to you.

## Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

- **You should avoid repeating code as much as possible.**
- We must keep in mind that we must find ways to reuse code we've already created to avoid getting tangled up.

### Why is it important?

- âž¢ **Makes the code more maintainable:** Avoiding repeating code helps us make changing functionality more practical.
- âž¢ **Reduces code size:** It makes it more readable and understandable because there's less code to understand.
- âž¢ **Saves time:** By having the code available for reuse, we can use it and shorten coding time.

## KISS = Keep It Simple [,] Stupid

This principle establishes that code, design, documentation, and everything related to it should be simple.

It establishes that:

- âž¢ Software should have as few components as possible
- âž¢ No unused functionality
- âž¢ Documentation should contain strict and necessary information
- âž¢ Code should be as obvious and simple as possible
- âž¢ Design should be simple

### Why is it important?

- âž¢ **More maintainable projects.** The code is easier to maintain and update.
- âž¢ **Less documentation.** There are fewer weird things to document by making the code simpler.
- âž¢ **Faster debugging.** By reducing complexity, errors can be found more quickly.
- âž¢ **Greater economic returns.** The three effects above allow the initial financial investment in the code created to yield greater returns.

> *"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."*

The following principles are based on these two principles.
